# ðŸš¢ [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://logistic-regression-titanic.streamlit.app/)

This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow using **logistic regression** to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals
- Clean and preprocess real-world data
- Train a logistic regression classifier
- Evaluate performance using metrics and ROC curve
- Build a Streamlit web app for predictions

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Launch the web app:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

3. Open the link in your browser and try different inputs.

## ðŸ§  Model
- Type: LogisticRegression 
- Accuracy: ~82% 
- Most important features: Sex, Pclass, Fare, Age
